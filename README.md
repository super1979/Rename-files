# Rename-files
# This is a group of 8 scripts (written in Python) that renames files.
# The way each file is renamed is based on the filename of the script.
# The following describes how each letter of the script's filename describes the script's function.

# 1st letter of script filename (How path is passed into the script?)
# P: Path hard coded
# U: User input path

# 2nd letter of script filename (Is there file type distinction?)
# Y: Yes
# N: No
# Script only distinguishes picture files and video files

# 3rd letter of script filename (Can it rename files in subdirectory?)
# S: Single directory
# R: Recursive
